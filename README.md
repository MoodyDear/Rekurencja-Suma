This is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library that calculates the recursive sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number. 
The user is prompted to input a non-negative integer, and the program computes the sum of numbers from 1 to that integer using recursion. The result is displayed in a pop-up message box.
